## How to play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing X or O in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins!
4. If all squares are filled and no one has won, it's a draw.

The game works great on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Give it a spin on your computer or phone!
